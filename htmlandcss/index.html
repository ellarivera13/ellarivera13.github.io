		</p>Several festivalgoers described the “chaos” that unfolded at Friday night’s Astroworld Festival in Houston, where eight people died and dozens more were injured after the crowd rushed toward the stage.</p>

		</p>The eight people who died include a 14-year-old, a 16-year-old, two 21-year-olds, two 23-year-olds, and a 27-year-old, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said during a Saturday press conference. One victim's age was not yet determined.</p>

		</p>Officials said that as of Saturday, 13 people are still hospitalized, including five who are under the age of 18. A 10-year-old is in critical condition.</p>

		</p>Madeline Eskins, a 23-year-old ICU nurse, has attended Travis Scott’s Astroworld music festival each year so far, in 2018, 2019, and 2021. The crowd at Friday night’s show was “way worse” than those of years past, she told BuzzFeed News.</p>

		</p>“I mean, the amount of pushing. People rush the stage whenever Travis comes on,” Eskins said. “They have mosh pits — I’m used to that. This was something completely different. I mean, nothing could’ve prepared me for this.”</p>

	</p>“I tried to look at my boyfriend; I couldn’t even turn my head to look at him,” she told BuzzFeed News. “I told him I needed to get out of there. He was like, ‘We can’t.’ And then I, honestly, I thought I was going to die.”</p>

		</p>Officials said 50,000 people were at the concert when the incident happened. Medical staffers at the festival were “quickly overwhelmed,” Houston Fire Chief Samuel Peña said, and more than 300 people were treated at the field hospital.</p>

		</p>Astroworld, an annual music festival produced by Scott, was sold out in under an hour this year when tickets were released in May. About 100,000 people were expected to attend the event, which the Houston rapper headlined, Variety reported. The festival was not held last year due to the pandemic.</p>
	</p>In a statement addressing the tragedy early Saturday, organizers said they were supporting local officials in their investigation. The Saturday concert has been canceled.“I’m absolutely devastated by what took place last night,” Scott wrote in a statement</p>
